# CVIP-DataScience-Task2

When running this notebook, you would have to reset the path to read the training data. I generally use a separate folder named 'data' to store all my training datasets. Just keep that in mind.

I have created 4 models for this- Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGboost Classifier, and ANN. The XGBoost Classifier works the best till now. But, I will hyper tune the parameters in a future update (soon)
to get even higher scores.
